# N-Panel Renaming

With Clean Panels, you have the flexibility to rename tabs in the N-Panel to suit your preferences. Whether you prefer a shorter name or a complete change, you can easily achieve it. 

**Getting Started**

1. Navigate to the Renaming tab, where you'll find a list of addons with their current tab names.
2. Simply double-click the tab name(right) to modify it.
3. Press confirm to apply your changes or restart Blender.
```{important}
Add-ons with multiple tabs (such as Auto-Rig Pro) will appear in the list with separate entries for each tab.
```
