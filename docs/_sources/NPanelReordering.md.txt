# N-Panel ReOrdering

Clean Panels provides you with the flexibility to rearrange your tabs in the N-Panel according to your preferences.

## Reordering the N-Panel


To get started, follow these steps:
1. Enable 'Show Advanced Options' in the addon preferences.
2. Once activated, two new sections will appear: one for N-Panel Reordering and another for N-Panel Renaming.
3. Navigate to the Reordering section, where you'll find a list of addons.
4. Next to the list, you'll find two arrows (up and down) that allow you to move the selected tab upward or downward.
5. Press "Confirm" to apply your changes, or simply restart Blender.

## Sorting per category

Enable this option to sort the N-Panel based on the order of addons in your N-Panel Filtering categories.

You can sort the addons in your filtering categories by using the Reordering button.

## Proper Ordering button

```Important Note: If you have Blender installed on your C drive, you will need to run it as an administrator (only once) to press this button.```

If your panels are out of order when using filtering or you are encountering 'Children-Parent Panel' errors in the console, you can fix them by pressing this button. This action injects a small piece of code into Blender's addon_utils module, allowing CP to track the order in which the panels are registered on boot. CP can then use that information to register the panels in the correct order.
